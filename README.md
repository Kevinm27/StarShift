Resurrection Part 1:
   Features I believe could be incorporated into the projected include:
    -   Adding a menu screen into the in game screen. Currently it just shows a text showing that the game is paused. THere is one issue I have with adding this feature, which would be the graphics.
    -   Changing up the score system or maybe even adding a Leaderboard. The score system is good, however, the score multiplier is a little brutal beacuse it resets after one hit so maybe changing up the way the multiplier works could easily be changed. In addition, I could create a Leaderboard, but I would have to look into it since I have never created one.
    -   The final implementation could be adding new bullet types, powerups, and maybe even death animations. Adding a new bullet type could be troublesum since I was not involved much when it came to the projectiles, however, it can be done. Powerups are already in the game but I want to try adding some more. And finally, the death animations are a simple addition just to add on.
